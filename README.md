unicode-branchless: fast char to UTF-8

Branchless encoding of codepoints into UTF-8.

This Rust library contains several functions that translate
a Rust `char` to an array `[u8; 4]` plus a length. (It would
be better to return `&[u8]`, but there is no reasonable way
to do this with Rust's ownership rules unless a mutable
slice is passed in â€” that approach was not chosen here.)

## Configuration

Choose one of three versions based on Rust compile-time
feature flags:

* Default version is branchless self-contained code.

* Feature `tabled` is branchless and uses table lookup for
  some constants.
  
* Feature `looped` has a controlling `while` loop that has
  one conditional and one unconditional branch per byte.

All versions produce identical results up to performance.

## Benchmarking

A very simple Criterion benchmark is included. On the
benchmark machine (AMD Ryzen 9 3900X):

* The default version runs in about 3.00ns on all inputs.

* The `tabled` version runs in about 2.75ns on all inputs.

* The `looped` version runs in linear time as expected.
  * single byte: 2.11ns
  * two bytes: 2.52ns
  * three bytes: 2.93ns
  * four bytes: 3.31ns.


This is a very micro-benchy microbenchmark. In a real-world
scenario:

* The tableless versions will cause additional register
  pressure.

* The looped version will likely perform worse unless
  its branch predictors stay around.
  
* The tabled version will likely perform quite poorly unless
  its tables stay cached in L1.

Thanks to Nathan for the question and Lorenz for the CLZ
insight of an earlier draft.
